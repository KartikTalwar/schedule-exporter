#Schedule Exporter

##Schedule exporter is a chrome plugin to export schedule from ibm websphere based schedular.

##Steps to export:

* Open your schedule in list view not table view (IMP)
* Click on schedule exporter icon on chrome
* Copy past replaced text and save in a new file named : schedule.ics
* Import this file in any calendar app.

###Future considerations:
* Create file: Require backend server and some donations :)
* Use API to directly import into applications.
